# Scroll Animation Engine

Engine to register performant animations that are driven (progress is dragged or progress change is triggered) by scroll.

Originally part of an animated header which transitioned from a big state to a small state based on user scroll.

Code is not yet as clean and well structured as I'd like to have it, but it works.

Let's see where this project goes.
